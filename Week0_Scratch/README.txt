Try and land your Rocketship on a landing pad.
L+R arrow keys to rotate
Up arrow to thrust (using fuel)
Down arrow to make Rocketship vertical for landing
Hitting the edge is game over
Landing correctly gives 100 points, fuel and health, and landing pad will move position and gravity will increase
If you're too fast, you bounce off and damage the ship.
When health or fuel are zero, game over!
